# Physics Engine

A dynamic, interactive particle and collision-based simulation built on HTML5 Canvas.  
Balls spring toward the center, collide and repel from the mouse with motion physics, and emit colorful particles in response to user interaction.

## Features
- Real-time collision detection and particle effects
- Mouse and touch interactivity
- Smooth canvas animation with requestAnimationFrame
- Clean, scalable structure
